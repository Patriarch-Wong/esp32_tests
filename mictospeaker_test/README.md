# ICS43434 → ESP-NOW → YwRobot speaker

Two **ESP32-S3 N16R8** boards stream live microphone audio without a router:

```text
ICS43434 → GPIO 4/5/6 → mic ESP32 → ESP-NOW → speaker ESP32 → GPIO 7 → YwRobot S
```

The receiver reuses the **I2S PDM output on GPIO 7** from the sibling
`../speaker_test/src/main.cpp` project, including its initial **15% output gain**.
No SD card, MP3 decoder, external I2S amplifier, or extra libraries are required.

## Wiring

Microphone board:

| ICS43434 pin | ESP32-S3 connection |
| --- | --- |
| SCK / BCLK | GPIO 4 |
| WS / LRCLK | GPIO 5 |
| SD | GPIO 6 |
| L/R | GND (left channel) |
| VDD | 3.3 V |
| GND | GND |

Speaker board:

| YwRobot module pin | Connection |
| --- | --- |
| S / signal | GPIO 7 |
| VCC / + | Supply matching the module's voltage marking |
| GND / − | Speaker ESP32 GND |

GPIO 7 drives the powered module's signal input, not a bare speaker. As in
`speaker_test`, PDM playback quality depends on the module's input filtering;
a low-pass filter or external audio DAC may be needed if it sounds noisy.
Keep the speaker away from the microphone to avoid acoustic feedback.

## Build and flash

Run commands from this project directory, not the separate starter in `test/`.
The platform remains pinned to Espressif32 7.1.3 / Arduino-ESP32 2.0.17.

```sh
# Compile both UART/COM firmwares.
pio run

# Identify the two USB ports.
pio device list

# Upload with explicit CLI ports.
pio run -e mic_tx -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420187371
pio run -e speaker_rx -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791

# Monitor either board at 115200 baud.
pio device monitor -e mic_tx --port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420187371
pio device monitor -e speaker_rx --port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791
```

Pass the port on the command line; no ports are saved in `platformio.ini`:

| Environment | Port |
| --- | --- |
| `mic_tx` | `/dev/cu.usbmodem5B420187371` |
| `speaker_rx` | `/dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791` |

The speaker mapping comes from `speaker_test`; the remaining adapter is assigned
to the microphone. This role assignment has not been physically verified.
Use separate terminals to monitor both boards. If ports change, use the new
paths with `--upload-port PORT` / `--port PORT`.

If using the native USB connector, use `mic_tx_usb` and `speaker_rx_usb` instead,
for both uploads and serial monitoring, and specify its port explicitly; native
USB ports differ from the UART ports above. Close serial monitors before uploading.
If download mode fails, hold BOOT, tap RESET, release BOOT, then retry.

Power both boards: the microphone sends automatically and the speaker plays
automatically. No MAC addresses need to be entered for the default broadcast mode.
Flash each board with its own role; flashing the same role to both will not work.
**Reflash both boards for AUD2 ADPCM.** The previous AUD1 PCM firmware is
incompatible and is deliberately rejected. The ADPCM firmware has been
compile-checked; its live RF/audio operation still needs testing on the two boards.

## Settings and diagnostics

Edit `include/app_config.h`:

- `micGain`: input gain, initially 1 (unity). Reduce if the microphone peak stays near
  32768; increase if speech is too quiet. Values 1–64 are supported.
- `speakerVolumePercent`: output gain, initially 15 to match `speaker_test`.
- `speakerUpsampleFactor`: initially 3, for 48 kHz speaker playback of the 16 kHz
  stream. Set to 1 to compare against the original 16 kHz output; reflash only
  the speaker after both boards have AUD2. The user reports a clearer local tone
  and less hiss at 48 kHz, but live audio still needs verification with ADPCM.
- `wifiChannel`: initially 6; both boards must use the same channel.
- `receiverMac`: initially broadcast. For unicast, copy the speaker's printed
  **station MAC** here and rebuild the microphone firmware.
- `transmitterMac`: optional receiver filter for the microphone's station MAC.
  All zeros accepts the first active sender, with a two-second source timeout.
- Pins and `micLeftChannel`: already set to the confirmed wiring above.

The link is unencrypted. Broadcast send completion confirms radio transmission,
not that the speaker received it; use the receiver's packet count to verify that.
A MAC filter or unicast destination alone does not add encryption.

Every five seconds, the microphone prints sent/completed/failed packet counts,
busy drops, capture errors, recent PCM peak/RMS, clipped samples, and raw left/right slot peaks. The speaker prints received,
missing/stale packets, queue drops, underruns, concealed gaps, I2S errors, and buffered packets.

- **RX packets stays at zero:** check roles, power, channel, distance, and any MAC
  settings. Both boards print their role and station MAC at boot.
- **RX packets grows but no sound:** check speaker power, S on GPIO 7, common
  ground with its board, volume, and the transmitter's peak level.
- **Mic peak stays zero:** check 3.3 V, GPIO 4/5/6 order, and L/R tied to GND.
- **Distortion:** reduce microphone gain or speaker volume; separate the boards
  acoustically. Missing packets/underruns suggest radio interference or range.

## Diagnose static

Reflash **both boards** after the capture/radio changes. Close monitors first.
Then open the speaker monitor using its explicit CLI port above and send:

- `t`: continuous local 500 Hz test tone, bypassing microphone and radio audio.
- `s`: digital silence through the same PDM output.
- `m`: stop PDM, disconnect it from GPIO 7, and hold the signal low.
- `a`: return to live microphone audio.

Press Enter after the letter. Keep the module's physical volume low for testing.
If the local tone is clean but live audio is noisy, inspect TX `Lpeak`, `Rpeak`,
`rms`, and `clipped` and the RX loss counters. The confirmed L/R-to-GND wiring
selects the left slot; its peak should respond to speech. Repeated full-scale
values at unity gain suggest a capture/wiring problem or a very loud input.
If static remains in `s` mode, transmitted microphone samples and missing audio
packets are excluded as its direct source: inspect PDM input filtering, power,
ground, and the speaker module. This test does not disable Wi-Fi activity.

Compare speaker `s` against `m`:

- Hiss in `s` but quiet in `m`: noise depends on the active PDM output. Check the
  analog input's low-pass filtering and output configuration. A software audio
  compression codec cannot remove switching noise generated after decoding.
- Hiss in both: investigate amplifier gain/noise, supply, ground, and RF pickup.
  Wi-Fi remains active in both modes, so this comparison does not isolate RF noise.
- `t`, `s`, or `a` reconnects PDM and resumes playback after `m`. Switching modes
  may produce a click; judge the steady sound after the transition.

The firmware captures signed PCM16, transports it as ADPCM, and decodes it back
to PCM before hardware PCM-to-PDM conversion. Espressif specifies a low-pass filter when connecting PDM DAC output
to an analog power amplifier; the module's input filtering has not been verified.
See [Espressif PDM TX line modes](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/i2s.html#pdm-tx-mode).

The user reports clearer MP3 playback on the same wiring, hiss during local tone
and digital silence, and no hiss with PDM stopped. That isolates a dependence on
active PDM but does not prove the external filter is the sole cause. The receiver
uses 48 kHz playback through 3x linear interpolation; microphone capture stays
at 16 kHz. The user reports a clearer tone and less hiss with this change.
The earlier MP3 track's exact sample rate has not been measured. The pinned PDM
driver changes its internal interpolation ratio with the PCM sample rate, so
this test changes that ratio from 6 to 2 while retaining the nominal 6.144 MHz
PDM clock. No clock-divider override was added.

The remaining live audio is reported as broken/crackling, with earlier RX logs
showing about 14% sequence gaps and TX logs showing busy drops. AUD2 reduces
packet frequency and bandwidth to test whether this improves continuity. It
does not denoise the microphone or guarantee radio delivery.

After reflashing **both boards**, confirm `ADPCM` on both and
`playback=48000 Hz, radio=16000 Hz` on the speaker. Send `a` on the speaker and
`t` on the **mic** monitor: this sends a synthetic 500 Hz tone through the actual
encoder, radio, decoder, and playback path. Mic DMA still clocks the sender.

- Radio tone clean, microphone speech noisy: focus on capture, mic gain/wiring,
  or acoustic feedback. Send `a` on the mic to restore capture.
- Local speaker tone clean, radio tone broken: inspect consecutive TX busy-drop
  and RX missing/underrun counters. Test close range before changing gain.
- `s` on the mic sends silence through the radio. `s` on the speaker bypasses
  radio audio. Always distinguish which monitor receives a command.

TX peak/RMS/clipping statistics describe the selected source; Lpeak/Rpeak still
describe the physical microphone. A remaining noisy local speaker tone still
needs output investigation; packet loss cannot cause noise in that local test.

## Audio transport

Audio is 16 kHz mono PCM16 in memory, encoded as 4-bit IMA ADPCM on the radio:
64 kbit/s codec data. Each 180-byte packet contains 320 samples (20 ms) as 160
ADPCM bytes plus a 20-byte header. The header includes AUD2 signature, boot
session ID, sequence, sample rate/count, initial predictor, step index, and a
reserved byte. Nibbles are high-first. Every packet carries its own decoder
state, so lost packets or sender restarts cannot desynchronize later decoding.
This is a custom packet container, not a WAV file.

At 50 packets/s this uses 72 kbit/s including our headers, before Wi-Fi overhead,
compared with roughly 274 kbit/s and 138 packets/s for the previous PCM transport.
The lossy codec trades some fidelity for reduced radio load; it cannot repair
bad microphone samples. Old AUD1 packets, malformed lengths/headers, invalid
step indices, and unsupported rates/counts are rejected before decoding.

The microphone captures both 32-bit I2S slots, selects the left slot in software,
and scales/clamps to PCM16. SD has an internal pull-down for inactive slots.
ESP-NOW uses a 6 Mbps PHY rate to reduce airtime. The sender permits one send in
flight and waits up to 8 ms for completion before dropping a block; microphone
DMA continues capturing during this bounded wait. The receiver validates packets in the Wi-Fi
callback and queues compressed blocks; decoding and playback run separately in
the Arduino loop through I2S DMA. It starts with three queued packets (60 ms),
keeps at most six (120 ms), and drops oldest
queued data when full, rejects duplicate/out-of-order sequence numbers, and
handles a transmitter reboot using the session ID. Short gaps are filled with
a fade to silence and a fade back into received audio; concealment is bounded
by available queue headroom. Queue starvation outputs silence and buffers again. No retransmission or
clock-drift resampling is implemented. Actual latency and audio quality require
hardware measurement.

## Checks

```sh
pio run -e mic_tx -e speaker_rx -e mic_tx_usb -e speaker_rx_usb
c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude checks/audio_packet_test.cpp -o /tmp/mictospeaker_packet_test
/tmp/mictospeaker_packet_test
c++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Iinclude checks/adpcm_reference_driver.cpp -o /tmp/adpcm_reference_driver
# Requires Python 3.9-3.12 with audioop; the Mac system Python has it.
/usr/bin/python3 checks/adpcm_reference_test.py /tmp/adpcm_reference_driver
```

The host check covers invalid packet rejection, decoding after skipped blocks,
sequence wraparound/duplicate rejection, gain clipping, signed fades, and bounded
gap concealment, signed 3x interpolation, packet-boundary continuity, silence,
and bypass playback. The independent audioop comparison checks encoder bytes,
decoded PCM, and final state for 356 blocks spanning all 89 step indices,
silence, a sine wave, full-scale transitions, and random samples. These checks do not simulate
ESP-NOW timing or the microphone/speaker hardware.
