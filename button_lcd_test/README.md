# SD-card video player for the ST7789 LCD

For the two-board ESP-NOW transfer with receiver video and GPIO8 audio,
use the separate [wireless_av project](wireless_av/README.md).

Plays the requested [YouTube clip](https://youtu.be/jQIr-AyWRts) from the
ESP32-S3 N16R8 board's built-in SD slot. The converted file is
`media/video.lcdv`: 240 x 136 pixels, 12 fps, 911 frames (75.92 seconds),
3,400,387 bytes (3.24 MiB). Playback is silent and centered on the
240 x 240 screen with black bars above and below.

The video loops automatically at boot once the file is on the card.
Press the GPIO4 button to pause/resume. The external LED lights while
pressed. The firmware streams one compressed JPEG frame at a time;
the full video is not stored in firmware or RAM.

## Wiring

| Component pin | ESP32-S3 connection |
| --- | --- |
| Button, first contact | GPIO4 |
| Button, other contact | GND |
| LED anode (+) | GPIO5 through a 330 ohm resistor |
| LED cathode (-) | GND |
| LCD GND | GND |
| LCD VCC | 3.3 V, for a 3.3 V compatible module |
| LCD SCL / SCK | GPIO10 |
| LCD SDA / MOSI | GPIO11 |
| LCD RES / RST | GPIO12 |
| LCD DC | GPIO13 |
| LCD BLK | Module-specified backlight power/enable |
| Built-in SD CMD | GPIO38 |
| Built-in SD CLK | GPIO39 |
| Built-in SD D0 | GPIO40 |

The SD mapping comes from the verified `../codec_sdtest` and
`../speaker_test` projects. SD uses 1-bit SDMMC at 20 MHz, independent of
LCD SPI. The seven-pin LCD has no CS: `lcd_cs_pin = -1`, SPI mode 3,
10 MHz. All settings are in `include/app_config.h`.

Disconnect power before changing wiring. For BLK, use direct 3.3 V only
if the module supports it with onboard current limiting or a logic enable.
A raw LED backlight needs its specified current limiting/driver.
The SD card must already have a supported FAT filesystem. Firmware does
not format the card.

## Build, upload, copy, play

From this folder, using the board's UART/COM connector:

```sh
pio run
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791
```

If download mode is required, hold BOOT, tap RESET, release BOOT, then
upload. Press RESET after upload. Close any serial monitor before copying:

```sh
python3 tools/send_video.py --port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791
```

The sender needs `pyserial`. On this Mac, PlatformIO's Python already has
it, so this command also works:

```sh
/opt/homebrew/opt/platformio/libexec/bin/python tools/send_video.py \
    --port /dev/cu.usbmodem5B420192791
```

It transfers acknowledged 4096-byte chunks to `/video.lcdv.part`, closes
and reopens the file, verifies SHA-256 from SD, then renames it to
`/video.lcdv`. A matching existing video is verified and reused. A different
existing video is preserved and reported as an error. A failed transfer
may leave the staging file; the next transfer retries that staging file.
The sender starts playback, waits for one complete loop, and exits while
playback continues.

Alternatively, copy `media/video.lcdv` to the root of the SD card with a
card reader, then insert the card and reset the board.

For the native USB connector, upload the `esp32-s3-n16r8-usb` environment
and pass its port to the sender. Both environments use 921600 baud.
`pio device list` shows available ports.

## Convert another video

The original was downloaded using the public HLS format after the default
format returned HTTP 403:

```sh
yt-dlp --no-playlist --no-cache-dir -f 230 \
    -o 'media/source.%(ext)s' 'https://youtu.be/jQIr-AyWRts'
python3 tools/convert_video.py media/source.mp4
```

The converter needs `ffmpeg` and Python's standard library. It preserves
aspect ratio inside 240 x 136, removes audio, and encodes baseline JPEG
frames. `--fps` controls frame rate and `--quality` controls JPEG quality
(2 is highest quality, 31 lowest; default 6). Source downloads are ignored
by Git. The original still-image files remain available, but the player
no longer displays them.

The `.lcdv` format is little-endian: 8-byte magic `LCDV0001`, 16-bit width,
height, fps, reserved zero, then 32-bit frame count and maximum JPEG size.
The 24-byte header is followed by repeated 32-bit JPEG lengths and JPEG
payloads. The player checks bounds and dimensions and stops on SD or JPEG
errors. It skips overdue frames to keep the intended playback duration.

## Diagnostics

Use `pio device monitor` at 921600 baud after the sender has exited.
Commands: `status` reports SD readiness and playback counters; `play`
restarts the clip; `pause` toggles pause/resume. `LOOP` reports completed
loops with decoded/skipped frame totals. These serial messages are for
file transfer and diagnostics; video rendering goes to the LCD.

If the LCD reports `Upload video over USB`, transfer the converted file.
`SD mount failed` means the card, its filesystem, or the SD connection needs
checking. A completely dark screen calls for checking LCD/backlight power.
Initialization and successful decoding cannot confirm physical LCD output.

Both PlatformIO environments build successfully. All 911 converted JPEG
frames passed a host decode check; malformed/truncated containers were
rejected by the sender.

Hardware check on 2026-09-25: copied 3,400,387 bytes to the onboard SD card
and verified SHA-256
`670c4e3193cb285b91d73c0f51be35525363b1db9693b7e97ba702b2b499b151`.
The board completed one loop: 902 decoded frames and 9 skipped to maintain
timing, with no SD or JPEG errors. The longest read/decode/draw took
89,340 microseconds. Pause/resume events were received during the check.
Playback was left running. Physical image quality still needs visual
confirmation on the LCD.
